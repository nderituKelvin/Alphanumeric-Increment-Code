# Alphanumeric-Increment-Code
For receipts and other systems that use unique alphanumeric codes to identify objects in their system. This code will help increment the alphanumeric of A-Z , 0-9. Written in PHP. Other languages will be coming up later on
.
If you have ever had the need to use unique code and you went for random chars and a while loop. then think of this: What will happen when you start having a million rows in your table?. Chance of repeating that while loop whill also become high and you DBMS will have to go through all those rows to ensure that there is no code like that
.
Increment is better since it is cleaner and you will be able to track the objects well
.
Keep watch
